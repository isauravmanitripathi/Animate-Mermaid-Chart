Clear node and connection structure\n\nCRITICAL: Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with EXACTLY these keys:\n\n{\n  \"new_additions\": \"ONLY the new nodes and connections you've added (NOT including header and classDefs, and NOT including any existing nodes/connections)\"\n}\n\n\nIMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Properly indent all code (4 spaces per level)\n- Put each node or connection on its own line\n- Start with section comments (using %%) to explain what the new additions represent\n- DO NOT include any content from the previous diagram\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object without any markdown code blocks or other text.\n",
