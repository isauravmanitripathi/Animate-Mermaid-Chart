This charter provided the Company with a monopoly over trade with the East, enabling it to establish trading posts and gradually expand its influence. Initially, the Company's activities were primarily commercial, focused on procuring goods like spices, textiles, and indigo for export to Europe.\n\nUse a sequential node-connection pattern with the following structure:\n1.

This perspective would emphasize the contributions of Indian leaders and thinkers in shaping the Constitution and would highlight the ways in which the Constitution departs from the British model. A historical continuity perspective would acknowledge the influence of British institutions and legal frameworks on the Indian Constitution but would also emphasize the elements of continuity and adaptation.\n\nUse a sequential node-connection pattern with the following structure:\n1. Define a node\n2. Immediately define any connections to previously defined nodes\n3. Move to the next node\n4. Repeat the pattern\n\nFor example:\n%% New node for current section\nD[Entity D]\n%% Connections from D to previous nodes\nA --> D\nC --> D\n%% Another new node\nE[Entity E]\n%% Connections to/from E\nD --> E\nB <--> E\n\nFollow these specific rules:\n- Only generate new additions that start EXACTLY where the previous diagram left off\n- Your new code must be syntactically compatible with the existing diagram\n- The new generated code should be interconnected with previous nodes, or create subgraphs if needed. \n- Format node labels clearly with relevant information (<entity><br><detail>)\n- Group related nodes with clear section comments using %% before each section and also subgraphs\n- Use descriptive node labels with relevant data points\n- Each time try to create a more interconnect graph so all of it is interconnected\n- Include bidirectional relationships where appropriate\n\n**Sequential Writing Pattern**\n* Define one node at a time\n* Immediately connect that node to previously defined nodes\n* Add clear section comments before starting a new group of related nodes\n* Follow a consistent pattern throughout the diagram\n\n**Node Definition Rules**\n* Use simple, unique IDs for each node (like E, F, G or more descriptive IDs)\n* Avoid reusing node IDs anywhere in the diagram\n* Enclose node text in square brackets: `A[Node text]`\n* Avoid HTML tags like `<br>` inside node text - use spaces instead\n* Keep node text relatively short to avoid parsing issues\n\n**Connection Rules**\n* Use `-->` for directed connections (arrows)\n* Use `---` for undirected connections (lines)\n* Use `<-->` for bidirectional relationships (only where specifically needed)\n* Define connections immediately after defining a new node\n* Ensure all nodes in connections are already defined before using them\n\n**Formatting and Spacing Rules**\n* Use proper line breaks between node definitions and their connections\n* Put each node definition and connection on its own line\n* Include an empty line between different sections for readability\n* Use `%%` for comments to explain sections or nodes\n* Keep comments on separate lines from node definitions and connections\n\n**Style and Color Rules**\n* Define styles using the `classDef` keyword at the end of the diagram\n* Apply styles to nodes using the `:::styleName` syntax after the node definition\n* Keep style definitions simple (color, stroke, stroke-width)\n* Use hex codes for colors\n* Define all styles in one section at the end of the diagram\n\n**Subgraph Rules (if needed)**\n* Define subgraphs with clear opening and closing syntax\n* Always include an empty line after the `end` statement closing a subgraph\n* Keep subgraphs simple and avoid nesting them too deeply\n* Define connections to nodes inside subgraphs only after the subgraph is closed\n\n**General Avoidance Rules**\n* Avoid complex formatting within node text\n* Avoid special characters that might be misinterpreted\n* Keep the diagram as simple as possible while conveying the necessary information\n* Test small sections if encountering errors with a large diagram\n\nWhen adding new nodes and connections:\n  1.
