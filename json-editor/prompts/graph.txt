Create a sequential Mermaid diagram for the following text about {topic}.

{context_message}

Text to analyze:
{text}

Use a sequential node-connection pattern with the following structure:
1. Define a node
2. Immediately define any connections to previously defined nodes
3. Move to the next node
4. Repeat the pattern

For example:
```
%% New node for current section
D[Entity D]
%% Connections from D to previous nodes
A --> D
C --> D
%% Another new node
E[Entity E]
%% Connections to/from E
D --> E
B <--> E
```

Follow these specific rules:
- Only generate new additions that start EXACTLY where the previous diagram left off
- Your new code must be syntactically compatible with the existing diagram
- The new generated code should be interconnected with previous nodes, or create subgraphs if needed. 
- Format node labels clearly with relevant information (<entity><br><detail>)
- Group related nodes with clear section comments using %% before each section and also subgraphs
- Use descriptive node labels with relevant data points
- Each time try to create a more interconnect graph so all of it is interconnected
- Include bidirectional relationships where appropriate

CRITICAL: Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with EXACTLY these keys:
{json_example}
