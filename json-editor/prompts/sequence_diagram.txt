Create a Mermaid sequence diagram for the following text about {topic}.

{context_message}

Text to analyze:
{text}

Use a sequence diagram structure with the following guidelines:
1. Define actors/participants for all entities involved in the interactions
2. Show chronological message flows between participants
3. Include activations where appropriate to show processing time
4. Add notes to clarify complex interactions

Follow these specific rules:
- Only generate new additions that start EXACTLY where the previous diagram left off
- Your new code must be syntactically compatible with the existing diagram
- Use descriptive labels for all messages showing what data or actions are occurring
- Include return messages where appropriate
- Show parallel actions with par blocks if needed
- Use alt/opt/loop blocks to represent conditional logic flows

CRITICAL: Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with EXACTLY these keys:
{json_example}
