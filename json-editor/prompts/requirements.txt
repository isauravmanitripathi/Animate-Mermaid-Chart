Create a Mermaid diagram that represents the requirements in the following text about {topic}.

{context_message}

Requirements text to analyze:
{text}

Use a graph structure with the following features:
1. Identify all requirements as distinct nodes
2. Categorize requirements (functional, non-functional, etc.)
3. Show dependencies and relationships between requirements
4. Highlight priority levels with different styling

Follow these specific rules:
- Only generate new additions that start EXACTLY where the previous diagram left off
- Your new code must be syntactically compatible with the existing diagram
- Use rectangular nodes for requirements with clear IDs (REQ-01, etc.)
- Use different node styles for different requirement types
- Show dependencies with appropriate arrows
- Include traceability to other artifacts where mentioned

CRITICAL: Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with EXACTLY these keys:
{json_example}
