Create a Mermaid state diagram for the following text about {topic}.

{context_message}

Text to analyze:
{text}

Use a state diagram structure with the following guidelines:
1. Use stateDiagram-v2 syntax
2. Define states for key activities, conditions, and decision points
3. Connect states with transitions showing the flow between them
4. Use notes to add important context where needed

Follow these specific rules:
- Only generate new additions that start EXACTLY where the previous diagram left off
- Your new code must be syntactically compatible with the existing diagram
- Format state labels clearly with descriptive names
- Add transition descriptions that explain the conditions for state changes
- Group related states into composite states when appropriate
- Include choice points for conditional branching of flows

When adding new states and transitions:
  1. Start with a comment indicating what this new section represents
  2. ONLY add new states and transitions related to the current text
  3. Connect these new states to existing states where appropriate
  4. Make sure each line has proper indentation (4 spaces per level)

CRITICAL: Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with EXACTLY these keys:
{json_example}
